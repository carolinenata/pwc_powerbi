# PWC: Power BI Virtual Internship

We are required to make 3 dashboards for our PWC Power BI Virtual case internship. Because of it's name, we are required to use Power BI to make our visualizations.

Call Center Dashboard: We are required to make call center dashboard to outline customer satisfaction, average calls answered/resolved, calls by time, average speed time to answer
and the call center agent's individual performance.

Customer Churn Dashboard: We are going to look at the customer demography and the service they subscribe. Getting customers is hard, so we do not want to lose them. We are going to look at our valuable customers and see which services are at risk because of losing customer retention.

Gender Diversity: Human Resource is trying to improve gender diversity. Help your client to see whether they have gender diversity applied in their company by looking at the % of men and women, % of leavers, % men and women promoted, % of turnover and average performance ratings of both genders. 

Please look into my dashboards files above for the files I make.
